# TopMusicMetrics
Top Music Metrics is a project I worked on with fellow university peers: Benjamin De La Torre, Mary-Grace Knepper, Vince Alihan, Sebastian Carrillo, Shizu Takura. We analyze what are key features of songs that predict their likelihood of reaching charts like the top 50, top 100, etc? using SAS, Feature Engineering, and Data Science techniques.
