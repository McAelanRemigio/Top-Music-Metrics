# TopMusicMetrics
Top Music Metrics is a project I worked on with fellow university peers: Benjamin De La Torre, Mary-Grace Knepper, Vince Alihan, Sebastian Carrillo, Shizu Takura. We analyze what are key features of songs that predict their likelihood of reaching charts like the top 50, top 100, etc? using SAS, Feature Engineering, and Data Science techniques.

Dataset used -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/spotify-tracks-genre-dataset

This dataset provides comprehensive information about Spotify tracks encompassing a diverse collection of 125 genres. It has been compiled and cleaned using Spotify's Web API and Python. Presented in CSV format, this dataset is easily accessible and amenable to analysis. The dataset comprises multiple columns, each representing distinctive audio features associated with individual tracks.

The columns include: artists (the name of the artist or artists who performed the track), album_name (the title of the album to which the track belongs), track_name (the specific name of each track), popularity (a numerical score indicating the popularity of a song on Spotify ranging from 0 to 100), duration_ms (the duration of each track measured in milliseconds), explicit (a boolean value denoting whether a song contains explicit content or not).

Furthermore, there are various audio features that provide deep insights into the musical characteristics of each track. These features include danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness (indicating whether spoken words are present in a song), acousticness (measuring how much a song leans towards acoustic sounds rather than electric ones), instrumentalness (indicating how likely it is for a song to be instrumental rather than vocal-oriented).

Additional audio attributes encompass liveness, reflecting the presence or absence of live audience elements within tracks; valence quantifying musical positiveness conveyed by a song; tempo denoting beats per minute; and time_signature revealing details about bar structures within tracks.

The dataset enables users to discern patterns across multiple genres while also facilitating genre prediction based on perceptible audio nuances derived through machine learning models.

Aspiring audiophiles, music enthusiasts,and data scientists can effectively harness this repository for research purposesâ€”fostering extensive exploration into genre dynamics and comprehending nuanced relationships between various musical attributes featured in these Spotify masterpieces
